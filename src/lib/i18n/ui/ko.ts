/**
 * Korean is the type source for every dictionary: a key missing from
 * `en.ts` fails `astro check` rather than rendering blank.
 *
 * Rules
 * - Whole sentences only. Never assemble a sentence from fragments.
 * - Interpolate data slots (numbers, dates) only; the words around the slot
 *   belong to the locale.
 * - English plurals get explicit `one` / `other` variants.
 * - Proper nouns come from `../proper-nouns`, never from here.
